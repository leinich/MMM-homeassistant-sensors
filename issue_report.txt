Sorry for what looks like a PR but is actuall an issue. 
There is no way to report issues on your repo...
MM  v2.16.0 no longer starts for me because of your module:
```
 [02.07.2021 15:04.54.518] [ERROR] Error: Cannot find module 'request'                                                                                        |
| Require stack:                                                                                                                                               |
| - /opt/magic_mirror/modules/MMM-homeassistant-sensors/node_helper.js     
```
The runtime dependency request was removed from core MagicMirror in version v2.16.0 (and replaced because it is deprecated).
Can you please fix your repo accordingly?
(as a workaround I had to manually install request (npm install request)

Thanks
